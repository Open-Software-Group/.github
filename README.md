# Open Software Group
## An organization for developing open source & truely free software

### Oops! There is nothing here yet?
Corret! This is a new organization, born in 2023. Repositories will be coming soon!

### Motivation and background
You may be wondering, why this group exist. Here is why:
Despite the fact that we have open source and free software on github (and in other places), some of it is actually not really free which to be hontest, drives me nuts!
A couple of years ago I was looking for an open source and free nodejs cms and I succeeded in finding some good ones. Yet, those come with really annoying limitations (e.g. limited number of roles, users)
and some of them even require you to sign in to the "cloud".

I don't know about you, but these examples drive me crazy. Now, with that information in mind, the whole purpose of this organization is to create _**actually free and open source software - no limitations whatsoever!**_

If you feel excited about it and share the same opinion as I do - welcome to the team!

### Current state of this group and projects
Here is a list of projects that this group is currently developing:
(This list can grow if necessary.)
- [x] OSG Software (an open source and free JIRA Software clone / project management tool for the web)
- [ ] OSG Invoice (an open source and free invoice management tool for the web)

### Current tech stack
The current tech stack consists of:
- [Spring (Boot)](https://spring.io) for backend services
- [NextJS](https://nextjs.org) for the frontend and UIs
- [Postgresql](https://www.postgresql.org/) as the database
- [Figma](https://figma.com) as the current design tool
